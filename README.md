## A series of tools for maximizing using agents for development.
---

This project is a series of scripts to help drive agent-driven-development.
These tools are intended for senior+ engineers. 

This program helps re-produce the process that I have been following when using programmin with agents. The process so far has been:

**Define the need, purpose and scope**
1. Define what problem you are solving and why you are solving it. 
2. Define how your project will approach this problem. 
3. Define a tech-stack you are comfortable with. (You should be reviewing code.)

**Define the tech stack, one that you are comforable with**
Your LLM of choice will create a series of questions to plan out the tech-stack, development, and integration of your application.

**Define the high-level overview**
Once you've answered these questions, the LLM of choice will create a high-level plan, broken down into deliverable milestones. Your job is now to review, clarify, and expand the milestones. 

**Define the boilerplate runtime & infrastructure**
The first milestone should always be boiler-plate runtime / infrastructure setup. Whatever your stack of choice prefered, the LLM agent should comply with your preferences. You should also define your prefered software architecture and pattern.  

**Plan a series of tasks for sequential milestone**
Once the your high-level project planning is done, you will ask the LLM to create a series of tasks to achieve each milestone. Each tasks must add one feature and do it well.
